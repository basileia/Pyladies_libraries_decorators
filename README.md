# Homework Decorators  
Study project for course Python and its libraries, Pyladies Ostrava, autumn 2020  
## Task 1:  
* Write a decorator that complements the decorated function with a print of the function name and arguments - suitable e.g. for debugging a program so that we know when and how the function is called.
## Task 2:  
* Write a decorator that measures the time the function works and prints the result - also suitable for debugging, if we find that a function takes too long and we want to verify it. Can be combined with the first decorator.
## Task 3:
* Write your own decorator
## Task 4:
* If an exception occurs in the function, it will provide a link to google, which will look for the specific error.
